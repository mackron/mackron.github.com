    <b>My projects</b>
    <p>All of my open source projects are on <a href="https://github.com/mackron">github</a> and are all public domain.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs">dr_libs</a>: a collection of public domain single-file libraries with minimal dependencies.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_wav.h">dr_wav.h</a>: a library for reading audio data from .wav files.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_vfs.h">dr_vfs.h</a>: a library for loading files from both the native file system and archives such as Zip files, with pluggable back-ends.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_fsw.h">dr_fsw.h</a>: a library for watching for changes to the file system. Windows only at the moment.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_path.h">dr_path.h</a>: a path manipulation library which never uses the heap.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_gui.h">dr_gui.h</a>: a low-level GUI library.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_mtl.h">dr_mtl.h</a>: a library for loading material files, compiling them into an intermediate bytecode representation, and then outputting them to shader code such as GLSL.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_util.h">dr_util.h</a>: a utility library for things that don't really fit in any particular category.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_2d.h">dr_2d.h</a>: (WIP) a library for drawing 2D graphics.</li>
                <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/dr_libs/master/dr_audio.h">dr_audio.h</a>: (WIP) a simple library for audio playback and recording.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mackron/dr_ge">dr_ge</a>: (very WIP) a simple "game engine" written in C, mostly from scratch, with a focus on simplicity and ultra light-weightness. Things that make it different:
            <ul>
                <li>Super simple build system. The entire engine is compiled as a single source file which can be added to your project just like any other.</li>
                <li>There are no external dependencies except for a few ubiquitous system libraries like pthreads and whatnot.</li>
                <li>Ultra light-weight with a goal to have executables for simple games (statically linked and including editing tools) to be less than 1MB.
                <li>A simple, clean, no bullshit API.</li>
                <li>Public domain.</li>
                <li>Entirely written in C (no C++).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mackron/dr_appkit">dr_appkit</a>: a toolkit for developing desktop applications on Windows and Linux. Used by dr_ge for it's editing tools.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTGameEngine">GTGameEngine</a>:
            a mostly discontinued attempt at a game engine which suffers from not-doing-anything-particularly-different-or-better-itus. See dr_ge which is a similar project with some
            features that make it quite a bit different from other alternatives. I'm keeping this project around just until I migrate all of the important stuff over to dr_ge.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>My games</b>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://teamrnr.itch.io/desert-sprint">Desert Sprint</a>: a simple top-down racing game made in Unity. Art by <a href="http://www.jairobinson.com">http://www.jairobinson.com</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://mackron.itch.io/paddler">Paddler</a>: it's just Pong. Made in GTGameEngine.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <b>My utilities</b>
    <p>These are just simple utility programs I've built which I've found useful for doing very specific things.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="dr_utils/dr_file2chex.exe">dr_file2chex.exe</a>:
            A simple console application which takes a file and converts it's raw data to an unsigned char[] array. I use this to inline small resource files so I can simplify
            the distribution of whatever it is I'm working on. Output is printed to stdout. Use -n MyVariableName to control the name of the array.</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
